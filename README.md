# Unsupervised Neural Coding of Nightingale Songs Using Deep Autoencoders

Implementation of an autoencoder for the unsupervised classification of nightingale songs. The the autoencoer is pretrained using stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and finetuned using backpropagation, as described in [1]. The implementation is done from scratch not using any deep learning libraries.<br/>
